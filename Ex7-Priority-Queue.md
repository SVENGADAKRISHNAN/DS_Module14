# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start the array printing function
2. Initialize a counter variable i to 0
3. Loop through each element of the array while i is less than size:
   Print the current array element at index i
   Increment i by 1
4.  Repeat the loop until all elements are printed
5.   Exit the function after printing all elements

## Program:
```

    printf("%d ", array[i]);
  printf("\n");
}
